                    Hello, I'm a computer science graduate from TUD ðŸ‘‹
                </p>

                        Good morning, evening or afternoon to whoever is reading this, My name is Wen Ting Song but many of my friends
                        call me Aman. So let me introduce myself a little, I am an aspiring Software Engineer that takes great interest
                        in all things internet and technology.

                        <h3>A little about myself</h3>

                        <p style={{ marginTop: 1 + 'em' }}>
                            What kind of person am I? Many people say that I'm a reserved and quiet individual and that is mostly true at times
                            but that doesn't mean I dislike social interaction, I've always enjoyed working with other people on team projects in college,
                            attending social gatherings and just simply hanging out with my friends.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: 1 + 'em' }}>
                            I believe myself to be a calm and composed individual, always logical and analytical in my way of thinking. I try to
                            always remain level-headed during stressful times such as trying to meet upcoming deadlines, fixing an aggravating problem or
                            other personal matters.
                            However I know very well myself that trying to contain and hide your stress is not a good thing for one's health and I'm
                            and I'm guilty of doing just that, putting up a front and to not worry others.
                        </p>

                            There are days where I feel introverted while on others I feel more outgoing and extroverted, but after an event or a night out,
                            my social battery needs to be recharged for a few days at home relaxing and sipping on a good ol cup of tea.

                            Whenever I have some free time, I enjoy playing some video games such as Terraria or Minecraft with or without mods,
                            I also enjoy watching some "Anime", my recent favourites including "Dandadan", "Frieren" and "Re:Zero".

                            On rare occasions, me and my friends plan and go on trips together, this year we went to Praha in Czech Republic. We had a blast
                            but some of them got way too blasted during the night which will always be our core memories together.
